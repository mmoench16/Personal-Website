      <title>BFI&#39;s 100 Greatest Movies</title>

      <description>In 2012, the British Film Institute (BFI) published a list of what are deemed to be the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time according to movie critics. The opinion polls were conducted by BFI‚Äôs Sight &amp;amp; Sound magazine and included more than 800 critics, programmers, academics, and distributors from all over the world.
You can see the list below. Please note, I assigned a rank from 1 to 100 (well, there actually seem to be 101 entries in this list ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ), which is slightly different to the original list where multiple movies can share the same rank.</description>

      <description>With the UCI Road Cycling Season 2019 well and truly come to an end I thought it would be nice to create a little animation that summarises the Team Ranking category (focussing on the top 3 team)..
Well done and thanks for the entertainment üëè:
 Final Ranking (23/10/2019):  Deceuninck-Quickstep ü•á Bora-Hansgrohe ü•à Team Jumbo Visma ü•â   In addition to the above, I thought it would be interesting to see how the UCI Team Ranking points would split over the different bike manufacturers that feature in the World Tour.</description>

      <description>Where to stay Where to get your bike from Where to ride   I recently went on a little (Mini) Training Camp / Holiday in Benalm√°dena (near M√°laga, Costa del Sol) and thought I would share my experience here. Somebody may find this useful ü§î ..
Where to stay As nice as it is to stay close to the beach and perhaps go for a nice little walk or sunbathing session after a hard day in the saddle, one thing to be aware of is that the Costa del Sol is very built-up.</description>

      <description>This quick tutorial will show you the very basics of using Shapefiles in R to generate maps with ggplot2 and rgdal. Along the way, we will create a Hospital Density Map for Scotland as the one below: Before We Start Geospatial data files aren‚Äôt necessarily free, in fact, a lot of service providers charge a handsome amount of money for them (after all, the generation of these files takes time, effort and money).</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of Daniel Shiffman‚Äôs work and particularly like his YouTube channel Coding Challenges.
One of the ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù is the creation of a Maze Generator using p5.js, the JavaScript implementation of the Processing language/package.
In this short article you can find my implementation of the Maze Generator √† la Shiffman. Run the Maze Generator below or head down to view the code.

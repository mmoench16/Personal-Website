With the *UCI Road Cycling Season 2019* well and truly come to an end I thought it would be nice to create a little animation that summarises the *Team Ranking* category (focussing on the top 3 team)..

Well done and thanks for the entertainment `r emo::ji("clap")`:

* Final Ranking (23/10/2019):
  + Deceuninck-Quickstep `r emo::ji("1st_place_medal")`
  + Bora-Hansgrohe `r emo::ji("2nd_place_medal")`
  + Team Jumbo Visma `r emo::ji("3rd_place_medal")`
  
*For the geeks amongst you, you can find the code to create above animation here: [GitHub](https://github.com/mmoench16/UCI-Bike-Rankings)*
